# CrmClientsRepository

For this CRM project I have created two classes.
  -Contacts
  -Opportunity/Customer

Each class has a service and a controller to be able to create methods and use them from the front end.


To start visualising the project you have to start both projects and put on the internet the url: "http://localhost:5173/login", 
to send us directly to the login and put the following credentials:
   -Email: solera@solera.com
   -Password: bootcamp4



When we put the credentials correctly, it sends us to the main page of the application, where we see 3 buttons:
  -ViewAllContacts -> We see all the contacts we have created in our application and below there is a button to return to the main screen 
                      and another one to create a new one. main screen and another one to create a new contact. When you create the contact,
                      you must create the opportunity.
  -ViewAllClients -> We see all the clients we have in our application.
  -ViewAllOpportunities -> We see all the opportunities in our application, and with a button on each one to change it to client or not.
                          Also a button to create a new opportunity, in which you must first create a new contact.



To better see the functionality of our application we can start the file contained in the following folder: 
"CrmClientsRepository\CRMSpringBoot\CRMSpringBoot\src\main\java\com\example\CRMSpringBoot\PruebaSelenium.java"
to start an automatic test created with selenium.
